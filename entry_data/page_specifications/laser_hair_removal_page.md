**Heading:** "Why Our Laser Hair Removal Works"

**Body Text:**
"Thanks to our highly powerful ICE MAX diode laser, we offer professional, permanent hair reduction which gives amazing results. The process involves a specific wavelength light that targets melanin in the hair follicle. The light is converted to heat, which damages the follicle enough to significantly slow down hair growth, without damaging the surrounding skin."

**How It Works - Numbered List:**
1. "You'll have a consultation to discuss your needs and what you'd like to achieve."
2. "During treatment the applicator is placed on the skin and a pulse of light is released, which heats the hair and destroys the cells responsible for growth."
3. "You may feel slight discomfort but the inbuilt cooling system built into the ICE MAX technology ensures most people find the treatment tolerable."
4. "The process is quick taking anything from 10 minutes to 90 minutes depending on the area treated."
5. "You'll receive a full aftercare information before you leave so you can properly care for your skin."

**Additional Info:**
"Everybody has unique hair growth patterns, so we recommend having 6-8 sessions to achieve best results for permanent hair reduction."

**Design Notes:**
- Clear, readable typography
- Numbered list with proper spacing
- Professional, informative tone
- Consider subtle icons next to each numbered step

"After just two treatments your hair will become thinner and softer as follicles are destroyed, permanently reducing hair growth. During treatment sessions we use Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) which is precisely administered to target the follicle under the skin causing minimal disruption to surrounding tissue. Throughout the full course of treatments, the interval between sessions will be gradually extended to accommodate the decreasing rate of hair growth."
