- Implement smooth scroll from navigation to this page

## Design System Integration
- Follow color palette from `branding_and_design.md`
- Use typography system: Serif for headings, sans-serif for body
- Maintain consistent spacing (8px base unit)
- Card shadows: Follow elevation system
- Buttons: Match brand style (outlined cream/gold or filled)
- Hover states: Subtle, elegant transitions

## Content Management Notes
