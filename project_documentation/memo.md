- `postcss.config.js` - Fixed Tailwind CSS PostCSS configuration
- `package.json` - Downgraded tailwindcss from 4.1.16 to 3.4.0

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Decision:** Integrated mobile menu directly into Header component instead of separate component
   - **Reasoning:** Reduces component complexity, keeps related functionality together
   - **Implementation:** Used React state to toggle mobile menu visibility

2. **Decision:** Downgraded from Tailwind CSS 4.x to 3.4.0
   - **Reasoning:** Tailwind v4 has breaking changes with PostCSS plugin requiring @tailwindcss/postcss package, and configuration incompatibilities with Next.js 16
   - **Reference:** Error #1 in errors.md
   - **Alternative Considered:** Upgrade to @tailwindcss/postcss, but configuration issues persisted

3. **Decision:** Contact link scrolls to footer instead of separate contact page

### Testing Results:
