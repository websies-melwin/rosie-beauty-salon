## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Tasks Requiring Client Access

These tasks **CANNOT** be completed until you have access to the client's accounts. The client (Rosie) has promised to provide access in a few days.

---

## Phase 10: Google Calendar Integration

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED - Waiting for client's Google account access

**What's Needed:**
- Access to client's Google account (rosiebeautyst@gmail.com or business account)
- Ability to create a Google Cloud Project
- Permission to enable Google Calendar API
- OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID + Client Secret)

**Why We're Blocked:**
- Bookings must sync to the client's actual business calendar
- Cannot use developer's personal Google account
- Calendar events need to appear in her schedule for appointment management

**Steps When Access is Granted:**
1. Log into client's Google account
2. Go to Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com)
3. Create new project: "rosie-beauty-salon"
4. Enable Google Calendar API
5. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application)
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - http://localhost:3010/api/auth/callback/google (development)
   - https://rosiebeautysalon.com/api/auth/callback/google (production)
7. Download credentials JSON
8. Add to .env.local:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxx
   GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary
   ```

**Files to Create (when ready):**
- `lib/google/calendar.ts` - Google Calendar API integration
- `app/api/calendar/sync/route.ts` - API endpoint to sync bookings
- Update `app/api/bookings/create/route.ts` to trigger calendar sync

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (with credentials)

## Phase 11: Email Notifications

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED - Waiting for client's email/domain access

**What's Needed:**
- Client's business domain (rosiebeautysalon.com or similar)
- Access to domain DNS settings (for Resend verification)
- OR access to client's Gmail for sending emails

**Why We're Blocked:**
- Confirmation emails must come from client's business email
- Domain verification required for Resend API
- Cannot use developer's email address

**Recommended Solution: Resend API**

**Steps When Access is Granted:**
1. Client creates Resend account (resend.com)
2. Verify domain in Resend dashboard
3. Add DNS records to domain settings:
   - TXT record for domain verification
   - MX records for email delivery
4. Get Resend API key
5. Add to .env.local:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=booking@rosiebeautysalon.com
   ```

**Alternative Solution: Gmail SMTP**
- If domain verification is too complex
- Use client's Gmail with app password
- Less professional (emails come from Gmail)

**Files to Create (when ready):**
- `lib/email/templates.tsx` - React email templates
- `lib/email/resend.ts` - Resend API client
- `app/api/email/send-confirmation/route.ts` - Send booking confirmation
- Update `app/api/bookings/create/route.ts` to trigger email

**Email Templates Needed:**
1. Booking confirmation (to client customer)
2. Booking notification (to business owner)
3. Booking cancellation
4. Booking reminder (24 hours before)

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours (with API key and templates)

## Phase 12: Admin Dashboard (Optional)

**Status:** üü° CAN START NOW - But better after Phases 10-11

**What's Needed:**
- Basic authentication for admin access
- Dashboard to view all bookings
- Ability to cancel/reschedule bookings
- Calendar view of appointments

**Why Wait:**
- More useful after Google Calendar and email are integrated
- Can cancel bookings and trigger calendar/email updates
- Not critical for initial launch

**Files to Create:**
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard
- `app/admin/bookings/page.tsx` - List all bookings
- `components/admin/BookingsList.tsx` - Booking table
- `components/admin/BookingActions.tsx` - Cancel/reschedule buttons
- `app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts` - Admin API endpoints

**Security Considerations:**
- Add simple password protection
- Or use Supabase Auth for admin login
- Restrict to client's IP or use basic auth

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
