          Why Our Laser Hair Removal Works
        </h2>
        
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg font-sans text-medium-gray leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Thanks to our highly powerful ICE MAX diode laser, we offer professional, permanent hair reduction which gives amazing results. The process involves a specific wavelength light that targets melanin in the hair follicle. The light is converted to heat, which damages the follicle enough to significantly slow down hair growth, without damaging the surrounding skin.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg font-sans text-medium-gray leading-relaxed">
              During treatment the applicator is placed on the skin and a pulse of light is released, which heats the hair and destroys the cells responsible for growth.

              You may feel slight discomfort but the inbuilt cooling system built into the ICE MAX technology ensures most people find the treatment tolerable.
