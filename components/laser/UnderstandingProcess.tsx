          After just two treatments your hair will become thinner and softer as follicles are destroyed, permanently reducing hair growth. During treatment sessions we use Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) which is precisely administered to target the follicle under the skin causing minimal disruption to surrounding tissue. Throughout the full course of treatments, the interval between sessions will be gradually extended to accommodate the decreasing rate of hair growth.
